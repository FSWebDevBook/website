        <h3><i>A New Undergraduate Textbook Coming in Fall, 2025</i></h3>
        <p class="left">Web development has become one of the most relevant and highly sought after skills in the software industry today. 
          <i>Full Stack Web Web Development from the Ground Up: Principes, Practices, and Technologies</i> presents a 
          systematic and modern treatment of this core area of software development, starting with the fundamentals of 
          front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; moving to front-end development with React; and culminating in 
          server-side development using Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB.</p>
          <p class="left">While the book uses the modern and widely adopted MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) to
              explore web development, its emphasis is not on the specific technologies themselves, but rather on underlying
              concepts, principles, and best practices that transcend any particular tehcnology stack. This approach
              lays a solid foundation for students to become curious, relective, and proficient web developers who can adapt to the rapidly
              changing landscape of web development technologies and practices.</p>

       <h3>About the Author</h3>
       <div class="author-section">
        <img src="images/Chris.jpg" alt="Chris Hundhausen" class="author-image">
        <p class="left author-text">Chris Hundhausen is a professor of computer science and Associate Head for Online Programs in 
          the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Oregon State University. He has been
          active in computing education research since the 1990s, specializing in algorithm
          visualization, studio-based learning, social learning environments, and software engineering education.  
          In 2017, Chris embarked on a sabbatical 
          as a professional web developer. His focus was to develop a 
          full-stack web application for speedgolf, an international
          sport which combines running and golf. He traveled to 
          speedgolf tournaments around the world to deploy SpeedScore
          and collect data on its use. The sabbatical kindled Chris's
          passion for web development and planted the seeds for this 
          book.</p>
